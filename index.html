    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The wind in the trees made strange noises while the two teenagers were walking home.</p>
    <p>Shivering, Meredith glanced up and thought she saw the Cheshire Cat glowering at her from a tree branch.</p>
    <p>"The queen is dead and gone", said the cat, smiling broadly. "At least gone. Long live Meredith!"</p>
    <p>Meredith stopped dead in her tracks. "Wait, whatâ€”?"</p>
    <p>"I don't want to be a queen," she said. "Queen of what?"</p>
